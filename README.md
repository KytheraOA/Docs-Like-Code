# Hello world!

This is my quick-and-dirty repo for testing out Docs-As-Code/Docs-Like-Code functoinality. It's not pretty, but it works! 

You can view the output here: https://kytheraoa.github.io/Docs-Like-Code/

I am a technical writer, not a programmer, so comments, suggestions, and constructive feedback are always welcome!
