# Welcome!

This is my Docs-Like-Code/Docs-As-Code example site. It's a little rough around the edges because I'm a technical writer, not a graphic designer. If you're reading this, you're probably more interested in my writing ability, anyway.

## Contents
1. [Home page](https://kytheraoa.github.io/Docs-Like-Code/) \(you are here)
2. [How to Change 3D Printer Filament](../filament.md) - A sample tutorial.
3. [How to Use Base Texture Stamps](../stamps.md) - A tutorial for hobby tools.
