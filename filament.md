# How to Change 3D Printer Filament (Bowden Tube)

If you're new to fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing, changing the filament in your printer is a frequent activity. It can seem intimidating at first, but with practice it gets much easier.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial uses a PowerSpec (Wanhao) Duplicator i3 Mini. It's an older printer, but still works. Also note that the Duplicator i3 Mini uses a [Bowden tube](https://all3dp.com/2/bowden-tube-all-you-need-to-know/). The process is a little different for printes with a direct drive extruder. I do not have experience with direct drive extruders, so instructions for direct drive estruders is outside the scope of these instructions.

## What You'll Need

1\. An FDM printer  
2\. A roll of compatible filament loaded into the printer
3\. A second roll of filament

> [!TIP]
> All printers are a little bit different. You should check the documentation that came with your printer and familiarize yourself with the menu options specific to your own printer.

## Remove the First Roll

1\. Look for the menu option that lets you change the filament.
  On my printer, the sequence is `Menu > Quick Settings > Change Filament > Remove Filament`.
  
2\. Confirm the menu option.
  When I confirm the option, the printer begins to heat the nozzle so that the filament in the nozzle softens.

3\. Wait for the nozzle to heat up.
  Be patient. It will heat up faster than you think!
  > [!CAUTION]
  > The nozzle will be very hot (220°C/428°F or higher)! Keep your fingers away from the nozzle to avoid burns.

4\. Use one hand to squeeze the filament drive lever to release the pressure on the filament.

5\. Use your other hand to gently push the filament forward a few milimeters.
  Some filament should ooze out of the nozzle. This confirms that the filament is soft enough to extract.
  
6\. Gently pull the filament out of the Bowden tube.
  If you pull the filament too fast, this can result a long string of filament stretching from the nozzle up the tube. Try pulling the filament a few cetimeters (or an inch), pause for a couple of seconds, then pull the filament the rest of the way out of the tube and clear of the filament clamp.

7\. Store the extracted filament.
  Secure the free end of the filament, place the roll in an airtight bag, and put it away.

## Add the Second Roll

1\. Navigate the printer menu to find the option for adding filament.
  On my printer, the sequence is `Menu > Quick Settings > Change Filament > Add Filament`.
  
2\. Confirm the menu option.
3\. Wait for teh nozzle to heat up.
  If you're adding the new filament right away, the nozzle may still be at temperature. If you waited or allowed the nozzle to cool down, you'll need to wait for it to heat up again.

4\. Place the roll on the holder. 
5\. Squeeze the filament drive lever and thread the filament through the filament drive and into the Bowden tube.
  This can be tricky if there's a lot of curl to the filament from being on the roll. Be patient.

6\. Keep holding the filament drive lever and continue to feed the filament through the Bowden tube.
  Push gently! When you feel resistance, the filament has reached the nozzle.
  
7\. Release the filament clamp.
  The pressure will allow the filament drive gear to engage and move the filament through the Bowden tube, into the heating block.

8\. Check for extrusion.
  Look to see if filament is being extruded from the nozzle. If filament is extruding, go to the next step. If filament is not extruding, check to make sure the filament is fed all the way into the heating block. Worst case scenario, there may be a blockage that you'll have to clear (beyond the scope of these instructions).

9\. Wait for the new filament to appear.
  Keep an eye on the extruding filament; some of the old filament will be left in the nozzle and needs to be pushed out ("purged"). If the new roll is a different color, wait until you see the new color start extruding. If the new roll is the same color, allow several cetimeters of filament to extrue to ensure the old filament is completely purged and the new filament is being extruded.

10\. End the "Add Filament" process.
  Navigate your printer's menu to ensure the "Add Filament" process has ended and the printer stops extruding filament.

11\. Clean up any extruded filament.
  The purged filament isn't needed. Make sure you clean it away from the nozzle (being careful not to burn yourself!) and throw it away. Remove any other debris from the build surface.
  
Now you're ready to begin a new print!
